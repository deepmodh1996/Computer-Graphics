Roll Number : 140050002

parameters used : { a : 0.5, b : 1, p : 0.2 }

Same parameters are used in extra images. Since location is different in two images, distance from feature vector should matter a lot, so a should be kept around 0.1 but since feature vectors are very near, small a diffuses the image.
